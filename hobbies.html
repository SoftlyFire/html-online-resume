        <br>
        <p>Hello! To get a gist of what/how I am, I have some hobbies that I love to do whenever I get a chance (or make time-kind of like a Dr's appointment) I dance (learning salsa), Raqs Sharqi BellyDance, Fusion Bellydance, reading Fantasy novels such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Naria, etc... Calligraphy Writing, or simply creating designs out of the blue. But overall I love spending quality time with my lovely family.</p>
