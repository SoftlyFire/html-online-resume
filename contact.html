        <h3>Brief Clarification gap</h3>
        <p>From the latest job (2011-present) I have dedicated my time to raising children (mine and also paid babysitting for others) as well as occasionally helping an elderly patient in their home (as a caregiver). BUT that never prevented me from learning through online classes and also using the internet to further enhance my knowledge and practicing skills such as Front End Web Development and Web Design . As you can see most of my work experience is in direct-person care, I do have experience in dealing with people and have the soft skills much needed in todayâ€™s times. Currently learning more about Web Design and Front-End Web Development as well as further enhancing my skills in Customer Service/Human Design. Thank you.</p>
